# experimental-metadata
*A framework for a simple, domain-independent, and extensible experimental metadata model.*

This repository holds artifacts related to the specification of a simple, domain-independent, and extensible experimental metadata model for describing research objects (ROs) such as datasets, protocols, experimental records, and publications. In these efforts we are clear to distinguish the notion of **general metadata**, which describes attributes of a research object itself, from that of **experimental metadata**, which describes an experiment related to the research object. There are many well established standards in place to describe general metadata (e.g. [DC](http://dublincore.org/), [DCAT](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/), [PROV](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/)), and recommendations about how to apply these (e.g. the [HCLS Dataset Description Standard](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/hcls/notes/hcls-dataset/) ). The greater and more pressing challenge is to similarly define standards around capturing experimental metadata - which describes how entities such as **techniques**, **specimens**, and **variables** are applied in an experiment that generated a dataset.


The documents contained here present our environmental scan to identify and evaluate related efforts, describe requirements analysis and use cases that informed our model, and document initial straw-man modeling proposals.  More formally defined models and documentation are to come, but at present the best place to start is to review the slide deck here which gives an overview of our work to date, and the document here that goes into greater detail about certain aspects of the work (e.g. the core concept glossary). The spreadsheets here contain some of the initial landscape analysis efforts we performed to inform our work.
